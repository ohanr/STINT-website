                Here at Stint, we firmly believe that anyone, regardless of citizenship status, deserves a fair chance at a future working in Australia.

                Ultimately, we aim to create a more equitable job landscape - supporting international students to land relevant jobs and internships, and educating employers to judge students based on their skills and experiences, rather than their citzenship status.

                Thatâ€™s why our vision is to deliver a better future for international students in Australia by transforming the way they are viewed - by employers, universities and governments alike.
